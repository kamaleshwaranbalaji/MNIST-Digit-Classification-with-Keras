# MNIST Digit Classification with Keras Sequential API

This repository implements a neural network model for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using Keras Sequential API.

## Features:

* Leverages Keras Sequential API for building a simple and efficient neural network model.
* Preprocesses the MNIST dataset for image classification tasks, including reshaping and normalization.
* Provides a clear structure for building and training a model (code for model building and training not included here).

## Getting Started

* Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/mnist-keras-sequential.git
* Install required libraries: pip install tensorflow keras numpy (other libraries may be needed based on your implementation)

## Further Exploration

This code provides a foundation for building a neural network model for MNIST digit classification. You can extend this project by:

  1. Implementing different neural network architectures (e.g., deeper networks, convolutional layers).
  2. Experimenting with hyperparameters (learning rate, number of epochs) to improve model performance.
  3. Visualizing the training process (loss curves, accuracy).
